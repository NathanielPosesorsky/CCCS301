    Use both factory pattern and observer pattern to simulate the following:
    - An animal factory creates Carnivores and Herbivores
    - Carnivores should have names and states
    - Carnivores should randomly change states between sleep and hungry
    - When herbivores see any of the carnivores is in hungry mode,
    all herbivores should hide, otherwise they will be in wander mode.
